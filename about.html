      <p class="aboutp1">So, way back when, I was born in little town called Chicago in the good old state of Illinois. My mom and dad was around and married. Still are to this day. When I went to school I was the biggest kid in class. Which, for some reason, gave people a reason to bully me (I guess they all knew I wasn't going to do anything about it!). Don't worry, I eventually grew up to not take any mess. Well, fast forward to a very distant future when I got into high school. I played football and loved it! And all the while, I LOVED to play video games! It was a very in depth passion of mine! So I wanted to learn how to make the games I very much so loved to play! When I started going on that path, people told me that was only for lame people and that I wouldn't get anything out of it. Sooooooo I quit the persuit! Fast forward AGAIN (I promise this is the last time), I met a very beautiful woman (Kaitlynn), had our first baby boy (Kingsley), and had our SECOND baby boy (Cameron), had to oppertunity to own my first functioning laptop(long story) and BOOM...here we are today! My name is Andre Ellis Jr. and this is what I love to do!</p>
